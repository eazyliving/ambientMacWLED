# ambientMacWLED
Fetch dominant color of a display and send that color to WLED.

Works with macOS. For different operating systems, you might want to use ffmpeg. I'm too lazy, figure out yourself.

You might want to change the display's number in ambient.sh. 1 for main, 2 for secondary display.
In dcolor.py you need to add your WLEDs hostname or IP.
